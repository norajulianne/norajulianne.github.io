            Initially, I wrote a very long text talking about all the things I didn’t know when I started working at the startup I’m currently at. Things like not knowing how to write a link tag, draw a line in an editing program, or even the meaning of a CMS. While it might seem strange to promote how little I knew about the things you need me to convince you I am good at, the point was this: there’s a lot I know and there’s a whole lot I don’t, but I’m always eager to learn. And I don’t sit around and wait for someone to offer to teach me. I go hunting for answers.
            </p>

            I deleted the long version of that text, as I’m thinking that you might just believe me even without it. If you’ve made it to this point, I'm hoping it's clear to you that I am a person who <i>commits</i>. That’s why I spent a lot of time making this application, and it’s why you should consider me for the role.
            </p>

            My experience has taught me that the things I value in a workspace are trust, collaboration, commitment, and an environment that allows for creativity and laughter.
